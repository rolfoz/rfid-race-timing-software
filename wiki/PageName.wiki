#summary It all starts here.
= Introduction =

I suggest using the latest 4.x version of Monodevelop to checkout/build the code. Either build from source or if you are running Ubuntu and lazy use this PPA.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ermshiperete/monodevelop
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install monodevelop-current

If you can help with the GUI or anything please get in touch.


= Details =

I just uploaded the 2 year old code, I'll start cleaning soon.
